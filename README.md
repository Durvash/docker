## What is Docker
Docker is a tool that lets you package your app and all its dependencies into a container, so it runs the same anywhere—your laptop, server, or cloud.

## Problems Docker Solves
1. "Works on my machine" – Same environment everywhere.
2. Dependency conflicts – Each app has its own isolated setup.
3. Complex setup – Easy to run multi-service apps.
4. Slow deployments – Fast and consistent with containers.
5. Heavy VMs – Containers are lightweight and efficient.
6. Hard to replicate environments – Easy with Docker images.
